# MyReads Project

Build a Book Read App using React, part of Udacity Course "Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program":
> In the MyReads project, you'll create a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

Udacity provided a starter code for this project: 
* All the CSS and HTML markup that may be used but omits the React code that is required to complete the project
* The provided code will demonstrate a static HTML page of the finished application, but with no interactive functionality
